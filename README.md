## 📚 Versions
- [**v1.1.2b1**](https://pypi.org/project/mathfox/1.1.2b1/) ⚠️ <b style="color: #fcba03">LATTER</b>. **---**
Addition of new statistical functions such as `median()`, `mode()`, `std()` and `var()`, and a new function that is `hypotenuse()`. We renamed some categories, such as **calculation** to **cal**, **geometry** to **geo** and **trigonometry** to **trigo**, and some functions such as `arcsin()`, `arccos()` and `arctan()`. We also added a new class which is `Decimal()` and a function which is `array()` which is under development, so its use is not recommended.


- [**v1.1.1**](https://pypi.org/project/mathfox/1.1.1/) 🔒 <b style="color: #089e00">RECOMMENDED</b> **---**
improvement of trigonometric functions and addition of the ``cot()``, ``sec()`` and ``csc()`` functions, in addition to the ``radians()`` and ``degrees()`` function which is in the **calculation** category 


- [**v1.1.0**](https://pypi.org/project/mathfox/1.1.0/) **---**
Removal of the `sumlist()` function, creation of the `Fraction()` class, renaming of the `isfloat()` function to `isdecimal()` and **math** category for **calculation** category, creation of a new category in the **calculation** category, which is **geometry**, within it will be the **area** category (which has been redefined), and the **trigonometry** category, which will have, in addition to the ``sin()``, ``cos()`` and ``tan()`` functions, it will have the ``asin()``, ``acos()`` and ``atan()`` functions.


- [**v1.0.2**](https://pypi.org/project/mathfox/1.0.2/) **---**
Correction of the `chance()` function, improvement of the `isint()` and `isfloat()` functions, creation of more decent documentation.


- [**v1.0.0**](https://pypi.org/project/mathfox/1.0.0/) **---** 
Library creation.
